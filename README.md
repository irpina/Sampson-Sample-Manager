**Universal Audio Sample Manager** — a cross-platform desktop app (Windows, Linux, macOS) for organising audio sample libraries for hardware samplers. Browse a source library, hear files before you move them, convert formats for specific devices, preview exactly how they'll be renamed and structured, then copy or move them in one click.

> Pre-built binaries (Windows .exe and Linux binary) available on the [Releases](https://github.com/irpina/Splice-Sample-Flattener/releases) page — no Python required.

## Features

- **Audio playback** — click any file in the preview to hear it instantly; navigate with ◀ ▶ ▶▶ transport controls or arrow keys
- **Hardware profiles** — path-limit enforcement and format presets for specific devices:
  - **Generic** — no limit
  - **M8** — 127-character SD path limit (Dirtywave M8), auto-convert to 44.1kHz/16-bit WAV
  - **MPC One** — 255-character limit
  - **SP-404mkII** — 255-character limit
  - **Elektron Digitakt** — Auto-convert to 48kHz/16-bit mono WAV
  - **Elektron Analog Rytm** — Auto-convert to 48kHz/16-bit WAV
  - **Elektron Syntakt** — Auto-convert to 48kHz/16-bit WAV
- **Folder structure modes** — choose how files land in the destination:
  - **Flat** — all files together in one folder
  - **Mirror** — preserve the full source directory tree
  - **One folder per parent** — group by immediate parent folder name
- **Rename pattern** — files are prefixed with their parent folder name (`Kicks_kick_01.wav`), keeping context in a flat folder. Disable with **Keep original names**.
- **Live preview** — Deck B shows every file alongside its renamed form before you commit; hover for a full-path tooltip
- **Copy or Move** — copy (default, non-destructive) or move
- **Dry run mode** — default-on; logs every action without touching the filesystem
- **Operation log** — colour-coded (red = move, green = copy, yellow = dry run, cyan = done)
- **Dark / Light theme** — MD3 near-black palette or warm 60s/70s pastels; toggle preserves your session
- **Audio conversion** — Convert samples to device-compatible formats:
  - Output formats: WAV, AIFF
  - Sample rates: 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz (or keep original)
  - Bit depths: 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit float (or keep original)
  - Channel conversion: stereo ↔ mono
  - Auto-apply presets when selecting hardware profiles
- **HiDPI / 4K support** — DPI-aware on Windows; scales via system settings on Linux/macOS

### Supported formats

**Input:** `.wav` · `.aiff` · `.aif` · `.flac` · `.mp3` · `.ogg`

**Output:** `.wav` · `.aif`

## Download

Grab the latest `SAMPSON.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/irpina/Splice-Sample-Flattener/releases) page and run it — no installation or Python needed.

---

## Running from source

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Requires Python 3.10+. Core dependencies:
- `pygame-ce` — audio playback
- `customtkinter` — modern UI widgets
- `pydub` — audio conversion
- `imageio-ffmpeg` — bundled ffmpeg binary (no separate install needed)

---

## Usage

1. **Set the source (Deck A)**
   - Click **Browse** or type a path into the source field.
   - The file browser populates with subfolders and audio files.
   - Click a folder to navigate into it; click **↑** or `..` to go up.

2. **Set the destination (Deck B)**
   - Click **Browse** or type a path.

3. **Preview and listen (Deck B)**
   - The table shows every audio file found alongside its renamed form.
   - **Click any row** to hear the file. Use **◀ ▶ ▶▶** buttons or **↑ / ↓** arrow keys to navigate and auto-play.
   - Hover over a name in the **Will become** column for a full-path tooltip.

4. **Configure options (centre panel)**

   | Option | Default | Description |
   |--------|---------|-------------|
   | Move files | Off | Move instead of copy. Off = copy (safe). |
   | Dry run | **On** | Log actions without writing files. Turn off to commit. |
   | Keep original names | Off | Skip the folder-prefix; keep original filenames. |
   | Folder structure | Flat | How files are arranged in the destination. |
   | Hardware profile | Generic | Enforces device-specific path length limits. |

5. **Click Run** (or press **Enter**)
   - The status bar and log panel update in real time.
   - Use **Clear log** to reset between runs.

## How renaming works

By default, each file is prefixed with the name of its immediate parent folder:

```
Source:       Drums/Kicks/kick_01.wav
Destination:  Kicks_kick_01.wav
```

This keeps a flat destination usable on hardware samplers while preserving context. Enable **Keep original names** to skip the prefix entirely.

When a hardware profile with a path limit is selected, the filename stem is silently truncated so the full destination path fits within the device's limit — the extension is always preserved.

## Theming

Click **☀ Light** / **☾ Dark** in the top-right corner to switch themes. Source, destination, and browser position are all restored after the toggle.

| Theme | Deck A accent | Deck B accent |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Dark  | Cyan `#4dd0e1` | Amber `#ffb74d` |
| Light | Avocado sage | Terracotta |

## Limitations

- Preview is capped at **500 rows** for performance; the file count still reflects the full total.
- The file browser only shows non-hidden subfolders and audio files.
- Destination collisions are not handled — if a renamed file already exists at the target it will be overwritten silently.
- Audio conversion requires ffmpeg to be installed separately.
- macOS packaging requires macOS hardware for building (notarized apps require Apple Developer account).
